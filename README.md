# Child Language Feedback Analysis

## Project Overview

The Child Language Feedback Analysis project aims to explore the influence of caregiver feedback on child language development, particularly focusing on various strategies such as repetition, elaboration, corrective feedback, and modeling adult conversation. The project investigates the role of positive and negative feedback in predicting the rapidity of child competency in specific language constructions during child-adult dialogues.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- Automatic detection of different feedback strategies used by caregivers in child-adult dialogues.
- Investigating which theoretically motivated dialogue behaviors predict the rate of child language acquisition.
- Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize and analyze various types of feedback.
- Employing simple interpretable models with linguistically motivated features to aid linguistic researchers in analyzing feedback findings.

## Methodology

The project will employ a combination of natural language processing techniques and linguistic analysis. Large Language Models will be utilized to recognize and analyze different types of caregiver feedback, while interpretable models with linguistically motivated features will provide insights for linguistic researchers.

## Expected Outcomes

The outcomes of this project are expected to:
- Shed light on how children exploit caregiver feedback to advance their conversational skills.
- Provide insights into the types of repetitions and interactions that can positively influence child language development.
- Have implications for the design of future conversational agents and human-computer interactions.
