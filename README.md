# Analysing Patterns of Repetition in Child-Adult Dialogues

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to study patterns of repetition in child-adult dialogues, focusing on the diverse feedback strategies employed by caregivers. These strategies encompass positive repetitions that affirm correct language constructions or present corrected versions of the child's attempts. 

## Methodology
- The talkbank CHILDES corpora will be used focusing on age-specific criteria to ensure relevance to the study of child-adult dialogues.
- The data selection procedure will center around ages 1-4, aligning with the critical developmental period for language acquisition.
- Recognising types of feedback
- Using LLMs to generate feedback
- Automatic and human evaluation of generated feedback

## Expected Outcomes

The outcomes of this project are expected to:
- Shed light on how children exploit caregiver feedback to advance their conversational skills.
- Have implications for the design of future conversational agents and human-computer interactions.
